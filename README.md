# Wrongbook Suite

> A local-first toolkit for learning from mistakes ‚Äî from quant interview prep to AI-powered knowledge graphs.

---

## üåê Live Demo
Try the apps directly in your browser ‚Äî no installation needed:

- **[QR Wrongbook (recommended)](https://yw562.github.io/qr-wrongbook/qr_wrongbook_v1.1.html)**  
  A feature-rich, local-first wrong question notebook tailored for quant & QR interview prep.

- **[AI Mistake Notebook (experimental)](https://yw562.github.io/qr-wrongbook/ai-mistake-notebook-v1.1.html)**  
  A lightweight mistake analyzer for code/math/ML with automatic concept extraction and knowledge graph insights.

---

## üìñ Overview
You can use either of the two HTML files included in this repository:
- **`qr_wrongbook_v1.1.html`** ‚Üí the recommended, feature-rich version for quant & QR interview prep.
- **`ai-mistake-notebook-v1.1.html`** ‚Üí the experimental version focusing on code/math/ML with knowledge graph insights.

Simply download the file you want, then double‚Äëclick it to open in your browser ‚Äî no installation needed.
This project combines two complementary tools:
- **QR Wrongbook** ‚Äî a rich, feature-complete wrong question notebook designed for **quant & QR interview preparation**.
- **AI Mistake Notebook** ‚Äî a lightweight, extensible notebook for **code, math, and ML mistakes**, featuring automatic concept extraction and a knowledge graph.

Both are **single-file, offline-first apps**: no backend, no tracking, just open in your browser.

## üîπ Module A: QR Wrongbook
> A local-first ‚Äúwrong question notebook‚Äù for quant & QR interview prep.

### Features
* üóÉÔ∏è **Local-first** ‚Äî data stored entirely in your browser (IndexedDB), works offline
* üß† **Rich metadata** ‚Äî category (Code / Math / Behavior / Machine Learning), difficulty (Easy ‚Üí Deadly), mastery (Not at all ‚Üí Mastered)
* üñºÔ∏è **Screenshot support** ‚Äî drag & drop, paste, or file picker
* üß™ **Focus practice mode** ‚Äî full-screen practice view, collapsible Hint/Solution, timer, and logs
* üí¨ **Comments** ‚Äî add & delete with confirmation
* üìä **Stats dashboard** ‚Äî study time, sessions, 30-day charts
* üîé **Search & filter** ‚Äî full-text, multi-select filters, sorting
* üé® **Themes** ‚Äî Light / Dark / Green gradient header
* üîê **Backup/restore** ‚Äî Export/Import JSON

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/yw562/qr-wrongbook.git
cd qr-wrongbook

# Local use
# Just double-click index.html in Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari
```

### Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Push `index.html` + `README.md` to the `main` branch.
2. Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Deploy from branch ‚Üí `main` / root (`/`).
3. Live at `https://yw562.github.io/qr-wrongbook/`.

## üîπ Module B: AI Mistake Notebook
> A lightweight notebook for code, math, and ML mistakes with knowledge graph insights.

### Features
- Input problem + optional answer/attempt.
- Auto/manual type detection (`code`, `math`, `ml`).
- Auto-generate **concepts**, **insight**, **explanation**, **solution sketch**.
- Unlimited storage in `localStorage`.
- Knowledge graph (node frequency & color by type).
- **Import/Export JSON**.
- Optional: integrate local **Ollama LLM** for richer analysis.

### Example Concepts
- *Math*: `size-biased sampling`, `Horvitz‚ÄìThompson`, `unbiased estimator`
- *Code*: `enumerate`, `indexing`, `off-by-one`
- *ML*: `overfitting`, `ROC‚ÄìAUC`, `cross entropy`

### Optional LLM (Ollama)
```bash
# Install Ollama
brew install ollama
ollama pull llama3.1:8b-instruct
ollama serve
```
Check **Use Local LLM (Ollama)** in UI.

## üì• Bulk Import / Export
The QR Wrongbook app supports exporting and importing problems as JSON files, so you can back up your data or add many questions at once.

- **Export** ‚Üí Use the Export button in the app to download all your problems as a JSON file.  
- **Import** ‚Üí Use the Import button and select a JSON file in the correct format.

### Ready-to-use helpers
- **BULK_IMPORT.md** ‚Äî full guide on how to structure import files (schema, examples, and an LLM prompt template for auto-generation).  
- **starter_import.json** ‚Äî a sample JSON file with one demo problem. You can copy, replace, or expand it to create your own batch of problems.

### Typical workflow
1. Write problems in plain text (Math, Code, ML, Behavioral).  
2. Convert them into the JSON format (see **BULK_IMPORT.md** or generate with an LLM).  
3. Save the JSON as a file.  
4. Click **Import** in the app and select it.  
5. Done üéâ ‚Äî all problems are added locally in your browser.

## üîÆ Roadmap
- Richer LLM support (more models, better prompts)
- Editable **Hint / Solution / Note** fields
- Graph interactivity: click node ‚Üí show related problems
- Spaced repetition scheduler based on difficulty
- Progress charts (error frequency over time)

## ü§ù Contributing
Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome!
- Fork and make a PR.
- Open issues for ideas/bugs.
- Suggestions for heuristics, prompts, or visualization especially appreciated.
